        "l. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - OOP is a way of programming where we organize code into objects that contain both data (variables) and functions (methods).\n",
        "  👉 Example: A Car object can have data like color, speed, and functions like start() or stop().\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   - An object is an instance of a class — a real thing created from the class blueprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "    - Abstraction = Hiding implementation details, showing only what’s needed.\n",
        "    Example: You just call car.start(), you don’t care how it starts.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Encapsulation = Hiding data using private variables and controlling access.\n",
        "      Example: Using _speed or __speed in a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "    - Dunder means double underscore (like __init__, __str__, etc.).\n",
        "    They are special methods that Python uses automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "    - nheritance allows a class (child/derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/base class).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   - Polymorphism means many forms — the same method name can behave differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "    - Encapsulation means restricting access to internal data by using private/protected variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "    - A constructor (__init__) is a special method automatically called when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "    - A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class.It can access and modify class-level variables (shared among all instances).\n",
        "    - A static method does not take self or cls as a parameter.\n",
        "It does not depend on instance or class variables — it behaves just like a normal function but lives inside a class for logical grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "      - Python does not support traditional overloading (same method name, different arguments).\n",
        "      Instead, you can use default parameters or *args.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "    - When a child class provides a new implementation for a method already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "    - The @property decorator turns a method into a read-only attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "      - Improves flexibility and code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Allows the same interface to be used for different data types or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Makes programs more maintainable and scalable.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "    - An abstract class contains one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation).\n",
        "Used when you want to define a template for derived classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "    - Code reusability\n",
        "    - Data security (encapsulation)\n",
        "    - Easy maintenance and scalability\n",
        "    - Supports real-world modeling\n",
        "    - Reduces redundancy\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Class Variable\tShared among all objects\tclass_var\n",
        "    - Instance Variable\tUnique to each object\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "    - When a class inherits from more than one parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of \" \tstr \t' and ' \trepr \t'' methods in Python.\n",
        "Method\tPurpose?\n",
        "    - __str__\tUsed for user-friendly output (called by print() or str())\n",
        "    - __repr__\tUsed for developer/debugging representation of an object\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
        "super() is used to call methods of the parent class from a subclass.\n",
        "    - super() is used to call a method from the parent (super) class inside a subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - It helps in code reuse and avoids explicit naming of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the \tdel \t method in Python?\n",
        "Destructor method, called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "    - It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed (when reference count reaches zero).\n",
        "  \n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "Access\tCannot access class or instance data\tCan access class data\n",
        "Usage\tUtility methods\tFactory or alternative constructors\n",
        "    - @staticmethod cannot access class or instance data (used for utility functions), while @classmethod can access class data and is used for factory or alternative constructors.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Both use same method name, but behave differently.\n",
        "    - Polymorphism means same method name, different behaviors depending on the object calling it.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line.\n",
        "    - Method chaining means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the \tcall\tmethod in Python?\n",
        "Makes an object behave like a function (callable).\n",
        "     - The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - When you write obj(), Python internally executes obj.__call__().\n",
